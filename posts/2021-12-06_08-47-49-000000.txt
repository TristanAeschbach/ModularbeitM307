                <div class='postText'><p><!---->Alpine junior Oscar Piastri won a shortened Formula 2 feature race in Jeddah, ahead of teammate Robert Shwartzman and Campos Racing’s Ralph Boschung. The race was red flagged and not restarted following two crashes and a lengthy pre-race delay, with only five laps completed and half points awarded.

Track repairs initially postponed the race, but when it did eventually get under way, there was a nasty collision between Theo Pourchaire and Enzo Fittipaldi that brought out a red flag. The Frenchman appeared to stall when the lights went out and the Brazilian was unable to avoid him, running into the back of the stationary ART Grand Prix.

Pourchaire and Fittipaldi were transferred to hospital and confirmed as conscious by an FIA statement.

The pair’s crash led to a lengthy red flag, after which the race was shortened to 20 minutes and one lap, with one mandatory pitstop and half points.<!----></p></div>
