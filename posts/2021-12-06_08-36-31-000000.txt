                <div class='postText'><p><!---->From reliability concerns for the championship leader to a first lap that could be race-defining, and from a high chance of Safety Cars to the title permutations for Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, we pick out some of the key areas to keep an eye on at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit.

1. Verstappen’s gearbox: Okay, this might be something you have to watch out for before the race as much as during it, but Max Verstappen’s crash at the end of Q3 was dramatic enough on its own before the potential knock-on effects. 
2. A crucial opening lap:
It's tough to make certain predictions about how a race is likely to play out at the best of times, let alone when it’s taking place on a circuit that is brand new to the calendar, but there have been some signs of what we can expect already this weekend. 
3. Leclerc as the joker in the pack:
While Mercedes will be hoping for Valtteri Bottas to hold Max Verstappen at bay, for Sergio Perez to join the party he needs to clear Charles Leclerc first. Leclerc wanted to repay Ferrari for the repair job they had to do on his car overnight after his FP2 crash, and he did that in a big way with fourth on the grid. 
4. Title permutations:
In case you missed it, this is the first race weekend where Max Verstappen can win the drivers’ championship, an opportunity he’s never had before in his Formula 1 career. In fact, Verstappen’s rise to F1 was so rapid he's actually never won a single-seater title, but that didn't appear to be weighing heavily on his shoulders as he has finished in the top two in each of the past six races.<!----></p></div>
