Rules kind of don't apply, or they don't think of the rules.
“[Max] is over the limit for sure,” he added. “I've avoided collisions on so many occasions with the guy, and I don’t always mind being the one that does that, because you live to fight another day, which I obviously did.
“Then he obviously brake-tested [me], I think to try and get the DRS into the last corner to overtake me again back into Turn 1, so there was a commotion. I thought that I'd lost my wing.”<!----></p></div>
